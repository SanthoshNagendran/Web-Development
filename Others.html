    <h2>Internships / Industrial Visits</h2>
    <p><b>SALZER Electronics</b>, is a company who manufacture electronic switches, relays and MCB’s. Gained knowledge on working of relays, switches and MCB’s. I felt the differences of the college life and work life. The environment was really different when i started the internship and I realized that i'm doing a professional degree. I had an opportunity to look how the professionals behave in the work culture and their punctuality was so impressive. </p>
    <p><b>PSG Industries</b>, manufacturers of Electrical motors. Gained hands on experience on making of motor coil winding and we were also taught the working nature of the motors. Had a good time spending time at PSG, able to relate the studies in class and applying the techniques in the real world nature. First time I saw the motor wiring and generators dismantling. They showed me how the generators and motors work on the different environment at different levels of power supply. Able to see the starters used to raise and fall the voltage and current without damaging the motor (Wear and tear).</p>
    <p><b>Seshasayee Paper & Boards Ltd.</b>, manufacturers and recycling of Paper and paper products. Learned and witnessed the process involved in making of paper (From pulp to the paper). When i was at college i was wondering how do power generation takes place in the real world. Before going to the SPB, i had an idea how does it takes place in a theory level. But here, other than the paper production and recycling, they concentrate more on producing the power for what they are using and also sell power to the Power Board. They have implemented a power on their plant where the process of production takes place as well as the product happening. They were doing both the things simultaneously, that's when this came to my mind "Efficiency". The plant is so efficient, as they concentrate on reproduction as well! Felt great being an intern there and improved my listening skill as there will be more of teaching in side the unit when the technician show us something.</p>

    <h2>Project Expereince</h2>
    <p><b>ROBOTEL - ATmega 2568</b>, The project is based on an objective to develop a modern technology Robot for replacing the servers working in the hotel. The main aim of this project is to replace the hotel food servers with robots so the efficiency of the delivery will also be good with respect to time, misplacement etc. This technology will also create a tremendous change in the autonomous world. The robot is developed in such a way that the robot has features to handle the food and clear the food when required. It also has the Speech instructions option where it will help the customers and the operators in a user friendly manner. It gives us each and every instruction as it works. Also it has the arm to deliver the food and to clear the food.</p>
    <p><b>VALVE POSITIONER FOR FUEL DISPENCER - STM32F303</b>, In this project we designed a smart dispenser which uses digital valve positioner to control the flow rate of a fluid in an efficient way and also includes the control of down tank pump with a good mechanical setup for the positioning. This can be used at any place where the flow rate should be controlled more precisely. When the user turns the electronic control knob (the flow rate scale with units, embossed around the knob of the flow control) to the level he wants to and the process starts!. Other than the valve positioner, the entire setup was brought out as a Printed Circuit Board, where we spent good time in capturing the schematic through the Altium Designer software and bought the components needed for this and did some soldering work (surface mount and through hole) to connect the hardware parts together.</p>
    <p><b>PERSONAL ASSISTANT ROVER - STM32F303</b>, We built a Personal Assistant Rover which will grab the objects from the predefined locations and bring it back to the user. To perform this task and to make the rover more interactive with the user and the real world some of the additional features were also included with it. We tried to imitate the human beings by their activities integrated to the rover. This can be operated in two modes; one is the manual mode where the user will take the control of the robot to operate it according to his/her wish. The other one is the autonomous mode where the rover will be operating itself by moving to the user selected predefined locations in its working place. There were few interesting things I learned from this, for example understanding hardwares, software principles, unleashed the image processing techniques and mechanics.</p>
